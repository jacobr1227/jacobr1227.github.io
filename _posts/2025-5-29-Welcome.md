Not really a whole lot to say right now. I mostly made this as a place for me to start sharing my experiences as I tackle my current project, a place to collect my thoughts or write about what I've learned and show off some of the oddities of development.

But hey, if this weird short post is really your cup of tea, then by all means keep reading what few words remain.

Also, I think you're cool and hope your day goes well.

Cheers.
