## Hey there!

There's not really a ton I have to say about myself here. I like to laugh, I like games and music and coding, and I like otters.
The otters are more of an outlier than anything, but they're so damn cute!

Anyway, this blog is where I intend to post my devlogs on some of the projects I'm working on, among other things, such as stories or thoughts I just feel the need to spit out unto the universe.

Feel free to read as much or as little as you see fit, and maybe go check out the music page when you're done with that! I like to keep it updated with some of my latest favorites.

Later.
